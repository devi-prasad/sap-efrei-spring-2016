(1) [15 marks]
Refer to the Java code used in lecture fourteen. This shows the instantiation
 of Observer design pattern in a specific context. With respect to this sample 
 code, answer the following:

    (A) Obtain the complete UML class diagram showing the relationships 
        between all the interfaces and classes used in the example.
    
    (B) Draw an UML sequence diagram representing the behavior of the 
        method named 'testOneAddRenameRemove' (lines 2-13) in the Client class. 


(2) [15 marks]
Show UML state machine diagrams for the following two requirements: 
    (A) Device Lock and Unlock.
        The device locks for 5 minutes if three successive attempts to unlock 
        the screen fail.

    (B) History States.

(3) [15 marks]
With respect to the Adapter design pattern
    (A) State the intent
    (B) State the applicability

    (A) Which are the active objects in this interaction?
    (B) Which are the synchronous calls in the diagram?
    (C) Which are the asynchronous messages here?
    (D) What operations are performed in the loop?
