(1) [UML Modeling] (25 Marks)
Draw a meaningful UML class diagram that captures the relationships between 
elements described below. Please write your assumptions too.

A system consists of numerous processes. Each process owns one or more 
top-level windows. When the process terminates, all top-level windows owned by 
that process also go away.

A top-level window may contain one or more child windows. There are four
kinds of child windows: List View, Text View, and Button. A child window 
CANNOT contain other child windows or any window as such.

DialogBox is a special kind of window. It can contain other child windows 
mentioned above. However, a dialog box CANNOT contain another dialog box or 
top-level windows. 

A top-level window can also contain shapes. There are four kinds of shapes: 
Line, Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.

(2) [Use cases] (25 Marks)
Identify at least three top-level use cases in the following description of 
a software alarm clock. Write the use cases that you identify.

Suppose that we wish to develop an alarm clock program. The clock should 
show the time of day. The user should be able to reset the time by changing 
hours and minutes fields separately.

It should be possible for the user to (re)set up to three alarms. When an 
alarm fires, it will play a predefined audio clip. The user can turn it 
off, or choose to ’snooze’. If the user does not respond at all, the alarm 
will turn off itself after 2 minutes. ’Snoozing’ means to turn off the 
sound, only momentarily. When in snooze mode, the alarm fires again after a 
delay of one minute. 

The program should allow user to adjust the ’snoozing period’. The default 
snoozing period is one minute, as mentioned above. The program SHOULD NOT 
allow the user to set snooze period less than one minute.
